## Question
Given a set of symbols with corresponding frequencies, find a code book that has the smallest average code length.

**Example**

| Character	| Frequency	|
| --------- | --------- |
| a			| 8.17		|
| b			| 1.49		|	
| c			| 2.78		|	
| d			| 4.25		|	
| e			| 12.70		|	
| f			| 2.23		|	
| g			| 2.02		|	
| h			| 6.09		|	
| i			| 6.97		|	
| j			| 0.15		|
| k			| 0.77		|
| l			| 4.03		|
| m			| 2.41		|
| n			| 6.75		|
| o			| 7.51		|
| p			| 1.93		|
| q			| 0.10		|
| r			| 5.99		|
| s			| 6.33		|
| t			| 9.06		|
| u			| 2.76		|
| v			| 0.98		|
| w			| 2.36		|
| x			| 0.15		|
| y			| 1.97		|
| z			| 0.07		|


## Solution
1.	Sort characters in increasing order of frequencies and create a binary tree node for each character. Denote the set just created by S.

2.	Create a new node n whose children are the two nodes with smallest frequencies and assign nâ€™s frequency to be the sum of the frequencies of its children.

3.	Remove the children from S and add n to S. Repeat step (2) till S consists of a single node, which is the root.
